# 🗂️ Excel Work Schedule Automation  
A self-updating Excel-based workforce scheduling tool designed to automate daily activity tracking, employee hours, and operational reporting for small and medium-sized teams.

## 📌 Overview  
This Excel model dynamically automates the full monthly scheduling process. It was created to simplify workforce planning by converting manual scheduling tasks into a clean, formula-driven workflow. The workbook automatically updates the number of days worked, days off, sick days, and holidays without requiring additional manual input.

The tool is ideal for supervisors, shift managers, operational analysts, and small business owners who need a simple yet powerful scheduling system without moving to complex workforce software.
